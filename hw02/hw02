LET us go then, you and I,  
When the evening is spread out against the sky  
Like a patient etherized upon a table;  
Let us go, through certain half-deserted streets,   
The muttering retreats          5
Of restless nights in one-night cheap hotels    
And sawdust restaurants with oyster-shells: 
Streets that follow like a tedious argument 
Of insidious intent 
To lead you to an overwhelming question….           10
Oh, do not ask, “What is it?”   
Let us go and make our visit.
