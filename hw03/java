Formed mostly as the result of volcanic eruptions, Java is the 13th largest
island in the world and the fifth largest island in Indonesia. A chain of
volcanic mountains forms an east-west spine along the island. It has three main
languages, with Javanese being the dominant language; it is the native language
of about 60 million people in Indonesia, most of whom live on Java. Most of its
residents are bilingual, with Indonesian as their first or second language.
While the majority of the people of Java are Muslim, Java has a diverse mixture
of religious beliefs, ethnicities, and cultures.
